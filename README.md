stable diffusion text2img and img2img AI with php 

stability.ai API text to image and image to image with php coding

because the stability.ai API documents has no clue of php version, develop from scratch FYI.

php+mysql+jquery
supported by php version >= 7.4.33

stabilityai.php is the text to image landing page.
sdimg2img.php is the image to image landing page. 

chrome browser and mobile phone visit with various jquery plugins.

plan for future:
complete the image to image/masking inpainting ,cuz stability.ai has no controlnet API for use, continue to follow the latest info on official website.
